"Mixed martial arts" means unarmed combat involving the use, subject to any applicable limitations set forth in these Unified Rules and other regulations of the applicable Commission, of a combination of techniques from different disciplines of the martial arts, including, without limitation, grappling, submission holds, kicking and striking.

"Unarmed Combat" means any form of competition in which a blow is usually struck which may reasonably be expected to inflict injury.

"Unarmed Combatant" means any person who engages in unarmed combat.

"Commission" means the applicable athletic commission or regulatory body overseeing the bouts, exhibitions or competitions of mixed martial arts.

## 2) WEIGHT DIVISIONS:

Except with the approval of the Commission, or its executive director, the classes for mixed martial arts contests or exhibitions and the weights for each class shall be:

| Bantamweight      | over 125 to 135 pounds |
| Featherweight     | over 135 to 145 pounds |

In addition, if one athlete weighs 264 pounds while the opponent weighs 267 pounds, the Commission may still decide to allow the contest if it determines that the contest would still be

fair, safe and competitive in spite of the fact that the two contestants technically weighed in differing weight classes.

- ii) If the mixed martial artists spent a majority of a round standing, then:
